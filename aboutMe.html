        <h2>Where my programming journey started:</h2>
        <p class="textBlurts" style="font-size: 17px">
            When I was in high school, I joined the schools robotics team on a
            wimb. That decision led me to where I am today and helped me chose
            computer science as my career path. I started as a grade nine
            student who knew nothing about programming or robotics and ended as
            the programming leader and one of the core parts of the team. That
            journey taught me many things aside from programming such as
            perseverance, teamwork and leadership. I also gained knowledge in
            C++ and Java programming. As a graduate, I now go back to my high
            school and other teams to mentor and help kids like me to fall in
            love with programming.
        </p>

        <h2>My life outside programming:</h2>
        <p class="textBlurts" style="font-size: 17px">
            I have a very bubbly personality that I like to bring into all
            aspects of my life. I enjoy spending time with friends and family
            but I also value alone time. I love both being out with friends and
            also being at home all alone snuggled in my bed with a good show on
            the TV. I live on a beautiful farm with many animals and love to sit
            with them and have quality time. We have pigs, chickens, bunnies,
            geese, ducks, and a rooster in our barn aswell as two dogs and a
            bearded dragon inside the house. As you can imagine, there is never
            a dull moment in my household and that is how I love it :)
